Online review set is a comprehensive reflection of consumers' collective intelligence. The upgraded products inherit the reputation of the original products. This research then proposes the hypothesis: in the same product life cycle stage, consumers have similar views on series products.
Then, the study attempts to verify this hypothesis by comparing the customersâ€™ reviews of Huawei P10 and Huawei P20 mobile phones on Amazon.co.uk. This thesis divides the review data flow with time tag into four time slices. Then, it uses the Grounded theory to review data set in each time slice, and obtain eight view categories (selective coding). The findings show that after composing these eight views and four PLC stages into a contingency table, using the Chi-square test and comparing the adjusted standardized residual, the distributions are significantly similar in a 95% confidence interval.
If a brand plans to achieve the optimal allocation of resources, it must invest resources in the areas where users are mostly involved in the current PLC stage. Based on the Grounded theory, this thesis presents a resource allocation optimization strategy for Huawei P series mobile phones in four PLC stages.
